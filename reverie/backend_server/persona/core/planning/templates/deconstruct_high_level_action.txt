Your responses should be in the format of:
{start} <-> {end} <-> {description}
Where start and end are 24-hour times that you plan on taking action, and the description is the description of what you're going to do.

An example response is:
13:00 <-> 13:05 <-> Open the weekly report document and review the progress made so far.
13:05 <-> 13:10 <-> Log into the project management tool to gather any new data or updates for the report.
13:10 <-> 13:25 <-> Summarize the new data into the report, updating relevant sections (e.g., performance metrics, team updates).
13:25 <-> 13:35 <-> Cross-check data against the current week’s objectives and deadlines, making any necessary corrections.
13:35 <-> 13:45 <-> Review the visual elements (charts, graphs) in the report, ensuring they are up-to-date with the latest data.
13:45 <-> 14:00 <-> Format the document to ensure consistent styling (fonts, headers, footnotes) throughout the report.
14:00 <-> 14:10 <-> Take a short break to rest eyes and refocus.
14:10 <-> 14:25 <-> Update the report’s executive summary to reflect current status and major changes from last week.
14:25 <-> 14:40 <-> Double-check the report for any missing sections or incomplete information.
14:40 <-> 14:55 <-> Proofread the entire document for spelling, grammar, and clarity.
14:55 <-> 15:00 <-> Save and back up the report, then email a draft to your supervisor for feedback.
