'''
Most data of a daily plan should be stored in the DailyPlanningData dataclass.
This is so that at the start of a new day, the data of the previous day can easily.
Be copied over and used for determining incomplete tasks, etc.

Tasks are Immutable except for setting the target, so it is safe to move them around
the system to be used as data for other methods in different objects.
